# bo-extramenu

This extramenu is designed for vehicle customization in FiveM, allowing players to easily add or remove extras from vehicles. The menu utilizes ox_lib's built-in context menu functionality for smooth operation. Players can open the extramenu either via a command or an export, providing flexible access to vehicle modifications.
